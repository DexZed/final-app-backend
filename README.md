# Computer Science Trivia & Fun Facts

Welcome to the world of computer science! Here's a collection of random trivia and fun facts to excite your inner geek. 🎉

---

## 🖥️ The Basics
- **Binary**: The core of computing, using just 0s and 1s. Did you know the number `42` in binary is `101010`? Also, it’s the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything" in *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*. Coincidence? Maybe not. 🤔

- **ASCII**: The letter "A" in ASCII is represented as `65`. Meanwhile, "😃" needs Unicode because ASCII wasn’t prepared for that level of happiness.

## 🛠️ Programming Languages
- **Python**: Named after *Monty Python* and not the snake. Expect plenty of "spam and eggs" references in its documentation. 🐍

- **JavaScript**: Was originally called *Mocha*, then *LiveScript*, before settling on JavaScript. It’s not related to Java, but both do love their coffee branding. ☕

- **C**: Developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie, it’s older than email. And yet, it's still used today for low-level tasks and breaking your brain over pointers.

## 📖 History
- The **first computer bug** was an actual moth found in the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947. Grace Hopper documented it, and the term "debugging" became iconic.

- **ENIAC**, one of the earliest computers, weighed over 27 tons and used 18,000 vacuum tubes. Imagine running Doom on that thing.

## 💡 Algorithms & Math
- The **Bubble Sort algorithm** is affectionately nicknamed "the beginner’s sorting algorithm," and not-so-affectionately nicknamed "the slowest way to sort anything." 🫧

- **NP-Complete problems**: They’re the reason why computer scientists cry at night. Solving one efficiently would solve all of them. Until then, brute force it is!

## 🌍 Internet & Networking
- The **first message on ARPANET** (precursor to the internet) was "LO". The team was trying to send "LOGIN" but the system crashed after the first two letters. 😅

- The **"@" symbol** became mainstream in 1971 thanks to Ray Tomlinson, who used it in email addresses to separate user and machine names.

---

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
- The term **"robot"** comes from the Czech word *robota*, meaning "forced labor." Sounds fitting, considering AI bots work tirelessly for us. 

- In 1997, **Deep Blue** beat Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, marking the first time a computer defeated a human in a match under standard chess rules. The machines are learning. 😨

## 🕹️ Fun & Easter Eggs
- The **Konami Code** (`↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A`) is a cheat code that works in some games, websites, and even Tesla cars. Try it! 🚗

- The **original Space Invaders** got harder as you destroyed more aliens, not by design, but because the processor could render fewer moving sprites faster. 🛸

---

## 🤔 Random Nuggets
- **Ctrl + Alt + Del** was initially a debugging shortcut invented by IBM engineer David Bradley. He didn’t think it would be used by millions daily to reboot their PCs.

- The term **"booting up"** comes from "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps," referring to a computer starting with minimal initial code to load the operating system.
